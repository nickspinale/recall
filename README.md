Haskell memoization library using -XTypeFamilies based off of [research] (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/assoc-types/fun-with-type-funs/typefun.pdf) by Simon Peyton Jones, Oleg Kiselyov, and Chung-chieh Shan.

Does this prove that -XTypeFamilies is the coolest feature of any language ever? I'm not qualified to say, but yes.
