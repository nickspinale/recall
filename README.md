# recall
Haskell memoization library using -XTypeFamilies based off of [research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/assoc-types/fun-with-type-funs/typefun.pdf) by Simon Peyton Jones, Oleg Kiselyov, and Chung-chieh Shan. In fact, the Memo typeclass and a few instances (Bool, Etiher, and List) come directly from thier examples.
